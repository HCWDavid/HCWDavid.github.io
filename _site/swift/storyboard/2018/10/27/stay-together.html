    <p>This is my first healthcare related competition that work closely on helping patients to refrain their opioid addiction.</p>

<p>“The Opioid Hackathon is a nearly 30-hour collaborative computer-programming event focused on tackling the opioid epidemic. Interdisciplinary teams of students, researchers, health and law enforcement professionals, and patients and family members were gathered to develop innovative solutions using data and technology. With more than 130 lives lost daily to opioid-related drug overdoses in the U.S., the need for novel approaches is clear. At the hackathon, registered teams will compete in one of a number of tracks, receiving appropriate datasets based on the selected track. They will then have 24 hours to use the data to develop their solution.”</p>

<p>Our team’s solution post a social media like platform to support patients closely with the help of family members, doctors, friends, and other patients to create a
friendly and positive environment. We luckily were the “Final Nominee” for the competiton and had a big idea to demonstrate to the world.</p>

<p>Here is our prototype (Storyboard):</p>
